          We all share the same planet, and while nature can exist without us,
          we cannot exist without nature. As wealthy, developed, and
          technologically advanced as we may be, ultimately, nature is the
          bedrock of our human existence and the key to human resilience,
          health, stability, and well-being

          At the current rate of deforestation, 5-10% of tropical forest species
          will become extinct every decade. Every hour, 1,692 acres of
          productive dry land become desert. We are using up 50% more natural
          resources than the Earth can provide. At our current population, we
          need 1.5 Earths, which we do not have.

          Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat,
          the air we breathe, the water we irrigate our crops with. We also rely
          on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our
          health, happiness and prosperity. These natural assets are often
          called the world's 'natural capital'.

          Be a green gardener by using peat-free compost and natural fertilisers
          and pesticides. Plant native species and be kind to all the insects
          and birds that feed on flower nectar and pollinate the fruits. If you
          can, support local wildlife around your home by setting up bee hotels,
          bird boxes, ponds and green roofs.
